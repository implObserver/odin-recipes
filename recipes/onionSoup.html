    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There are legends about onion soup: romantic and not so romantic. According to one version, onion soup dates back
        to the Roman Empire, and in 17th century France it was considered a poor man's dish as it consisted of only
        three ingredients: beef broth, bread crusts and fried onions. It was then that the classic recipe for onion soup
        emerged. Another version is that onion soup was accidentally invented by King Louis XV of France, who woke up in
        his hunting lodge in the middle of the night, starving. No servants were around but the enterprising king
        managed to find a bottle of champagne, butter and onions in the pantry. He used these incongruous ingredients to
        make a dish that has been called the ancestor of modern onion soup.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>onion - 6-8 pcs.</li>
        <li>butter - 3 tbsp.</li>
        <li>wheat flour - 3 tbsp.</li>
        <li>beef bouillon - 600 ml</li>
        <li>bay leaf - 1 pc.</li>
        <li>baguette slices - 6 units</li>
        <li>Hard cheese (emmental, gruyere) - 150 g</li>
        <li>salt - to taste</li>
        <li>sugar - 1 tbsp (no slice)</li>
        <li>thyme - 3 sprigs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Cut the onion into quarters and then into thin strips and melt the butter in a frying pan.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Saut√© the onions over a medium heat, stirring constantly, for 20-35 minutes until soft and lightly golden. At the
        end, add the sugar and stir in.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Pour half the hot beef stock (you can replace it with vegetable stock or chicken stock) over the onions and add
        the thyme leaves. Cook without the lid on for 15 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Pour in the remaining stock and salt. Cook for another 40-60 minutes, stirring constantly with a wooden spatula.
        The soup should be quite thick.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>While the onion soup is boiling, make the croutons. Cut the baguette into 1.5 cm wide slices. Bake in the oven or
        toaster until crusty.</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Pour the onion soup into the pots, 2 cm from the top. Sprinkle the soup over the grated cheese, top with croutons
        and sprinkle over the cheese again.</p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Put the pots in the oven for 5-7 minutes. The cheese should get a brown crust. Remember that you can't ruin onion
        soup with cheese!</p>
