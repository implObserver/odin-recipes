    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Russian dumplings... How Russian are they in fact? After all, it is known that until the 30s of the XIX century
        dumplings were not mentioned in Russian literature, while the Siberians and Ural residents were already actively
        making and eating them. And if you dig even deeper, it remains to accept the fact that this dish was cooked in
        ancient China, where, most likely, it spread across Asia, Siberia and, finally, reached central Russia. However,
        it is here that dumplings have become incredibly popular, thanks to their simplicity and nourishment. Of course,
        you can buy Russian dumplings in any shop. But if you want a high-quality and tasty product, then do your best
        to make them yourself.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>200 ml water</li>
        <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>600g wheat flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>250 g minced beef</li>
        <li>250 g ground pork minced meat</li>
        <li>1 large bulb</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>salt, black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Prepare the dough for the Russian dumplings. Sift the flour into a heap. Make a hole in the top, pour in the egg
        and 1 tbsp water, then add a pinch of salt.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Knead the dough from the edges towards the middle, making sure that the water and egg do not leak out of the
        cavity, adding the remaining water in small batches. Knead the dumpling dough until it becomes elastic and
        homogeneous, about 10 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth and leave to rest for 30 minutes. The water for the
        dumpling dough should be iced. Put it in the refrigerator or freezer in advance.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>While the dough is proving, prepare the dumpling filling. Peel the onion and garlic and chop them very finely.
        Mix the ground beef and pork, add the onion and garlic, salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly until smooth.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Divide the prepared dough for the Russian dumplings into 4 portions. Cover 3 parts with a damp cloth and set
        aside. Roll the remaining dough into a 2 cm thick roll. Cut the roll into 1.5 cm wide pieces. Roll out each
        piece of dough into a thin cake on a lightly floured surface.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Place 1.5 tsp of filling in the centre of each cake and fold the circle with the filling in half to make a
        crescent shape. Pinch the ends of the crescent rolls together and staple them together. Press down firmly with
        your fingers so the dumplings won't fall apart Cook the dumplings.</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Place the dumplings on a tray or flat dish, sprinkle with flour and place in the refrigerator. Prepare the
        dumplings in the same way with the remaining dough.</p>
